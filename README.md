# Postqueue Feeds Plugin

This is an extension for the [Postqueue Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/postqueue/) and provides rss feeds for each Postqueue found in the store.
Postqueue-Feeds are available under http://yoursite.com/?feed=postqueue-slug or http://yoursite.com/postqueue-slug.xml or http://yoursite.com/feed/postqueue-slug/.
Make sure to save permalinks for reflushing rewrite rules after adding a new Postqueue.
